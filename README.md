# Stencils
Place for various stencil projects

Each folder contains two .rar archives, one with "Gerber files" and another with "Production files". Since there wasnt a direct way to make a stencil itself, i had to design footprint for the chip, then place the chip on PCB and order stencil for that PCB. Gerber files are the PCB production files (raw files pretty much), while "Production files" is gerbers which has been processed by JLCPCB and adjusted specificly for reball stencil production. Would highly suggest using Production File when ordering the stencils. I ordered 0.2mm thickness, seemed most logical for reballing using balls, will see how it goes.

For now, all of the stencils are untested - i have received them and made sure that they properly fit, ball pitch and size matches the chip, but i dont have correct size balls to attempt the actual reball. Adding a list below to later on confirm the stuff which has been tested already so we can keep track of it.<br />

Micron_Controller_DM02A1 - Untested <br />
Micron_DRAM_D8CSC - Untested <br />
Micron_NAND_FP51208UCM1-B1 - Untested <br />
Micron_NAND_NY253 - Untested <br />
Phison_Controller_PS5018-E18-41 - Untested <br />
Phison_Controller_PS5026-E26-52 - Untested <br />
